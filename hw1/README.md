# DNA Analysis
By Eli Blaney & Jack Bilsland

## Purpose
This small project reads a CSV database of STR DNA sequences and people holding a given number of those STRs. It can then take an arbitrary number of DNA sequences to compare against the database to find possible exact or close matches.

## Usage
Run the program, and provide a path to a CSV database, such as the following:

```csv
name,AGAT,AATG,TATC
Alice,5,2,8
Bob,3,7,4
Charlie,6,1,5
```

Then, provide a DNA sequence to compare against the database, such as this one:

    AGATAGATAGATAGATAGATAATGAATGTATCTATCTATCTATCTATCTATCTATCTATC

## Contrib
This project was created by Eli Blaney and Jack Bilsland for an assignment for CSC 321 at Creighton University. For educational use only. Do not steal this code for your homework assignments.
